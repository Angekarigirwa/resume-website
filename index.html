            <p>
                I’m an aspiring software engineer from <strong>Rwanda</strong>, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at the African Leadership University (ALU). My studies have strengthened my technical foundation while allowing me to embrace creative problem-solving approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a deep interest in blending technology and creativity, I enjoy developing intuitive web experiences and designing visuals that communicate purpose. My skills include both front-end development and graphic design, giving me the flexibility to create fully-rounded digital solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Technically, I’m well-versed in languages such as <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>. I thrive on projects that challenge my logic and imagination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inspired by platforms like freeCodeCamp and hands-on experience, I’m gradually expanding my expertise in full-stack development, database systems, and automation. This broad perspective enables me to design scalable solutions that are also user-centered and efficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m currently open to freelance work and internship opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn. If you're interested in collaborating or exploring my portfolio, please feel free to get in touch.
